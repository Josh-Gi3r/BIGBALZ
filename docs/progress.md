    - Others get cheeky responses directing them to @MUSKYBALZAC
    - Implemented across all handlers (commands, messages, buttons)
    - Multiple rotating sassy responses about sliding into DMs

39. **Moonshot/Rug Query Fix (2025-01-14)** - Fixed user discovery issue:
    - "any moonshots?" and "any rugs?" queries now show summaries
    - Added dedicated handlers before contract validation
    - Shows recent findings from background monitor
    - Displays moonshots by tier with truncated contracts
    - Lists rugs with skull emojis

40. **Enhanced Moonshot/Rug Summaries (2025-01-14)** - Complete overhaul:
    - **Background Monitor Changes:**
      - Now stores full MoonshotAlert and RugAlert objects
      - Preserves token symbols, networks, and all metrics
      - Enables rich data display in summaries
    - **Moonshot Summary Format:**
      - Shows full contract addresses (copyable)
      - Displays token symbols and network names
      - Uses tier-specific emojis (üöÄ, ‚ö°, üí∞)
      - 24-hour window instead of 45 minutes
      - Professional markdown formatting
    - **Rug Summary Format:**

      - Knows which token and network before analyzing
      - Actually useful summaries instead of truncated addresses

41. **CRITICAL MOONSHOT DETECTION FIX (2025-01-16)** - Major bug fixes:
    - **Issue Identified:**
      - Moonshot detection was checking SPECIFIC timeframes for each tier
      - Tier 3 (2x) only checked 24h, Tier 2 (10x) only checked 1h, Tier 1 (100x) only checked 5m
      - This was COMPLETELY WRONG - should check ALL timeframes for EVERY tier
    - **Fixed Implementation:**
      - Now checks ALL timeframes (1m, 5m, 1h, 24h) for each moonshot tier
      - Uses the HIGHEST price change across all timeframes for qualification
      - Added missing 1-minute price change variable and calculation
      - Proper moonshot detection logic:
        ```python
        # Find the highest price change across all timeframes
        best_price_change = max(price_change_1m, price_change_5m, price_change_1h, price_change_24h)
        # Then check against tier thresholds
        if best_price_change >= 10000:  # 100x tier
        elif best_price_change >= 1000:  # 10x tier  
        elif best_price_change >= 100:   # 2x tier
        ```
    - **Impact:** Now properly detects moonshots that spike on ANY timeframe, not just specific ones

42. **COMPLETE RUG DETECTION OVERHAUL (2025-01-16)** - Total system redesign:
    - **Removed Severity Ranking System:**
      - Eliminated severity levels (REKT TO OBLIVION, MEGA REKT, etc.)
      - No more severity scores or rankings
      - Changed from severity-based to type-based detection
    - **New Detection Logic - 60 SECONDS ONLY:**
      - Compare ONLY to snapshot from 60 seconds ago (not 5 minutes)
      - Removed all complex historical averaging
      - Simple binary detection: rug or not rug
    - **Updated Thresholds:**
      - Liquidity Drain: 40% drop + final liquidity < $1,000
      - Price Crash: 60% drop
      - Volume Dump: 500% spike
    - **Detection Priority Order:**
      1. Check liquidity drain first
      2. If no liquidity drain, check price crash
      3. If no price crash, check volume dump
    - **History Management:**
      - Reduced history from 60 to 10 snapshots
      - Only keep last 10 minutes of data
    - **New Alert Format:**
      - Specific messages for each rug type
      - Proper spacing between lines
      - Rotating savage commentary
      - Example format:
        ```
        üö® RUG ALERT: LIQUIDITY DRAINED!
        
        Token: $SCAM
        Network: ethereum
        Contract: 0x123...abc
        
        üí∏ Liquidity: -85.5%
        üìâ Price: -92.1%
        
        The devs just vanished faster than your profits
        ```

43. **NAVIGATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION (2025-01-16)** - Multi-result browsing:
    - **Moonshot Navigation:**
      - Track moonshot list and current index in bot handler
      - "‚Üê Back" and "Next ‚Üí" buttons for browsing multiple moonshots
      - Maintains auto-deletion timer when navigating
      - Shows position indicator (e.g., "Moonshot 2 of 5")
    - **Rug Navigation:**
      - Same system as moonshots but for rug alerts
      - Separate tracking for rug list and index
      - Consistent button text across both systems
    - **Navigation State Management:**
      - Lists persist during navigation session
      - Index bounds checking to prevent errors
      - Buttons only show when applicable (no Back on first, no Next on last)
    - **Button Handler Updates:**
      - Added prev_moonshot, next_moonshot callbacks
      - Added prev_rug, next_rug callbacks
      - Reuses existing alert display logic

## Session Summary (2025-01-16) - Major Feature Additions

### What Was Done Today:

1. **Fixed Critical Moonshot Detection Bug**
   - User reported moonshots were checking wrong timeframes
   - Was checking ONLY 24h for 2x tier, ONLY 1h for 10x tier, ONLY 5m for 100x tier
   - Fixed to check ALL timeframes (1m, 5m, 1h, 24h) for EVERY tier
   - Now uses highest gain across all timeframes
   - Added missing 1-minute price tracking

2. **Complete Rug Detection Overhaul**
   - Removed entire severity ranking system (no more REKT levels)
   - Changed from 5-minute comparison to 60-second comparison
   - New thresholds: 40% liquidity (with <$1k check), 60% price, 500% volume
   - Reduced history tracking from 60 to 10 snapshots
   - New alert format with proper spacing and savage lines

3. **Multi-Result Navigation System**
   - Added Back/Next buttons for browsing multiple moonshots
   - Same navigation for multiple rug alerts
   - Shows position (e.g., "Moonshot 2 of 5")
   - Maintains auto-deletion timers during navigation
   - Proper state management with bounds checking

4. **Interactive Gem Research Feature**
   - Brand new token discovery system
   - 4-step guided search: Network ‚Üí Market Cap ‚Üí Age ‚Üí Liquidity
   - 6-tier classification system for found gems
   - Handles "find gems" queries with smart detection
   - Full implementation in new gem_researcher.py file

5. **All Git Commits Made:**
   - "Update moonshot detection"
   - "update Rug Detection"
   - "Added Liquidity constraint to rug detection"
   - "Added navigation for moonshots and rugs"
   - "Added Gem search function"
   - "Update documentation"

### Technical Implementation Notes:

- Moonshot fix was in background_monitor.py - check_moonshot_criteria method
- Rug detection rewrite in same file - check_rug_criteria method
- Navigation added to button_handler.py with new callbacks
- Gem research is completely new module with session management
- All features confirmed to have 25-minute auto-deletion

### Key Decisions Made:

- Moonshots should check ALL timeframes, not specific ones per tier
- Rug detection should be simple: 60-second comparison, no complexity
- Navigation should show full results, not summaries
- Gem research needs guided flow due to API limitations
- Keep commit messages simple and descriptive
